Use Vue CLI

## Running my Code

1. Run `npm install` in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This will create a `node_modules` folder which is missing otherwise 
2. Run `npm run serve` to bring up the development server, view the app at `localhost:8080` (or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
